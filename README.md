# 📊 Linear Regression Model in Python

This project provides a simple interactive linear regression tool built in a Jupyter Notebook. It works with any `.csv` file and lets you choose independent (`X`) and dependent (`Y`) variables for single-variable linear regression. 
This model also help you predict the value of dependent variable base on independent variable.

p/s: for everyone who is struggling with statistic class like me =))
